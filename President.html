    <h1> What sort of factors influence the Presidents' ablity to get in office and have a succesful career? </h1>
    <h2> Data collection </h2> 
    <p> The way we collected our data was from a site called Tuva labs. <br>
      We basically looked at two different data sets, which contained all of the data that we ended up needing for this project. </p>
    <h2> Data analysis </h2>
    <p> We analysed the data by first organising it from the charts on tuva labs into our own charts from google sheets. <br>
      We then looked at the connections between the different attributes of the presidents and compared them if there was any sort of connection. </p>
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>After analyzing connections between attributes  such as executive orders, avocation, party, and years served in office, we determined that there is a connection between avocation and years served and between party and number of executive orders. <br>
      For example, Lawyers and public officials have an easier time getting elected and keeping office for eight years. <br> 
      Also, Republicans have a lot more executive orders on average than all others. </p>
    <h2> Images </h2>
    <p> Here is an image of the Executive orders per year compared to the party of the president </p>
