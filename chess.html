           <h1> how to get good at chess </h1>
           <h2> the first moves </h2>
           <img src="chess-board.jpg" alt="A chess board showing the first move of a chess game">
           <p> Every chess player is different, but all of the experienced chess players know what to do for the first few moves. <br>
               We all generally start out with getting our pawns into the center of the board, <br> as this gives us more control in the center of the board quickly <br> and gets our queen and biship ready to move. <br>
               We can also move our knights into the middle position as this will give us more control too. </p>
           <h2> power positions </h2>
           <img src="chess-power.jpg" alt="A chess board showing places of power on the board">
           <p> The best defense is a good offense so let's get to know how to attack. <br>
               The best way to attack is to put your pieces in positions of general power throughout the board. <br>
               These positions are shown in the image, some of them require the queen to be moved or the piece to be covered by another piece. <br>
               Keep in mind, these positions are only good if your opponent remains relatively dormant and doesn't move to interfere with these, <br>
               but the best power positions are very game specific and are often very unique. <br>
               The best way to see these is with overall practice.
           <h2> the start of a game </h2>
           <img src="chess-start.jpg" alt="A chess board showing the start of a chess game">
           <p>
           The most common mistakes that I see in chess are in the beginning and middle portions of the game. <br>
           The image above shows the optimum positioning for the knights, biships and center pawns at the beginning of the game. <br>
           Notice how the pieces are all in the middle and are designed to control the middle of the board/ <br>
           The reason for this is that the middle of the board is the most important part of the board because it allows for your units to get into offensive positions. <br>
           You want your units in an offensive position, so that they can attack the opponent and at the same time keep their units at bay. <br>
           If you are sucessful in keeping your pieces in an offensive position you can dominate the field and take a lot of your opponent's pieces, allowing you to win a lot easier. 
           <br> Also, castling is a very exellent defensive play when you are in a pickle.</p>
           <h2> practice makes perfect </h2>
           <p> The best thing to do to improve your chess game is simply to practice. <br>
               Practice, along with making mistakes can improve your chess eye and allow you to see what your opponent can do in their next turn. <br>
               Losing can teach you how to improve your strategy by showing you what sorts of moves that your opponent's stategy had aginst you. <br>
               Later, when you face that strategy again you know what kinds of moves to do or not do in preperation for those moves that you lost to earlier. <br>
               However, I can't just give practice to you through an online website, so go out there and play chess. <br> I mean it took me two years to reach the level I am.
