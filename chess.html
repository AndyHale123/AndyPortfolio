           <h1> how to get good at chess </h1>
           <h2> the first moves </h2>
           <img src="chess-board.jpg" a="A chess board showing the first move of a chess game">
           <p> Every chess player is different, but all of the exerienced chess players know what to do for the first few moves. <br>
               We all generally start out with getting our pawns into the center of the board, <br> as this gives us more control in the center of the board quickly <br> and gets our queen and bishup ready to move. <br>
               We can also move our kinghts into the middle position as this will give us more control too. </p>
           <h2> power positions </h2>
           <img src="chess-power.jpg" a="A chess board showing places of power on the board">
           <p> the best defence is a good offense so lets get to know how to attack. <br>
               the best way to attack is to put your pieces in positions of general power thought the board. <br>
               these positions are shown in the image, some of them reuire the queen to be moved or the piece to be covered by another piece. <br>
               keep in mind, these positions are only good if you opponent remains relitively dormant and dosen't move to interfer with these, <br>
               but the best power positions are very game specific and are often very unique <br>
               the best way to see these is with overall practice.
           <h2> the start of a game </h2>
           <img src="chess-start.jpg" a="A chess board showing the start of a chess game">
           <p>
           the most common mistakes that I see in chess are in the begining and middle protions of the game <br>
           the image above shows the opimum positioning for the knights, bishups and center pawns at the beginning of the game <br>
           notice how the pieces are all in the middle and are designed to control the middle of the board <br>
           the reason for this is that the middle of the board is the most important part of the board because it allows for your units to get into offensive positions <br>
           you want your units in an offensive position so that they can attack the opponet and at the same time keep their units at bay <br>
           if you are sucessful in keeping your pieces in an offensive position you can dominate the field and take a lot of your opponet's pieces, allowing you to win a lot easier. 
           <br> also, castling is a very exelent defensive play when you are in a pickle</p>
           <h2> practice makes perfect </h2>
           <p> The best thing to do to improve your chess game is simply to practice <br>
               practice, along with making mistakes, can improve your chess eye and allow you to see what your opponet can do in their next turn. <br>
               Loseing can teach you how to improve your stratigy by showing you what sorts of moves that your oppoenst statigy had aginst you. <br>
               Later, when you face that stratigy again you know what kinds of moves to do or not do in preperation for those move that you lost to earlier. <br>
               However, I can't just give pratice to you through an online website, so go out there and play chess, <br> I mean it took me two years to reach the level I am.
