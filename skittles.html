    <h1> How does a color of a skittle relate to it's density </h1>
    <h2> Data collection </h2>
    <p>We began collecting our data by using a balance to find the individual mass of each Skittle. 
      <br> We then added the mass of a set of 20 Skittles(all the same colors) and divided it by 20 to find the average mass of each skittle.
      <br> We did that particular mass test for each color of skittle(Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Orange). 
      <br> We also put the same sets of 20 into a graduated cylinder to find the total volume using water displacement, and then divided that number by 20 to find the average volume of each skittle.
    <br> here is an image of us seperating the skittles for data collection. </p>

    <h2> Data analysis </h2>
    <p> After we measured the average volume and mass of the skittles, we then proceed to calculate the density of the skittles. 
    <br> What we found was that the color of the skittles had little to no impact on the density. 
    <br> The grape skittle had the highest density, about 5g/ml above the rest, which makes sense because in nature grapes are a dense fruit. 
    <br> Here is the speadsheet of our data.

      <br> and here is a bar graph of the densities of the skittles. </p>

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> The purple skittles, or grape skittles have the most mass at 1.04 grams. 
      <br> The grape skittles also have the highest density at 1.48571 g/mL. 
      <br> Yellow or lemon and green or lime are tied for lowest mass at 1.005 grams. 
      <br> Lime skittles have the lowest density at 1.41055 g/mL, but overall the color of the skittle doesn't affect the density that much. </p>
