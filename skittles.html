    <h1> The skittles project </h1>
    <p> The skittles project was a project for my CS class. <br> In the project, we collected data to answer an intersting question about skittles, <br>
      In our group, our qestion was how the flavor of the skittle affects its density, <br> We measured the skittles' mass and volume to find their densities. <br>
      We found that the color of the skittle didn't make too much of a difference. <br> our exact data can be found by clicking <a href=""> here </a> </p>
