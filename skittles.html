    <h1> How does a color of a skittle relate to it's density </h1>
    <h2> Data analysis </h2>
    <p> After we measured the average volume and mass of the skittles, we then proceed to calculate the density of the skittles. 
    <br> What we found was that the color of the skittles had little to no impact on the density. 
    <br> The grape skittle had the highest density, about 5g/ml above the rest, which makes sense because in nature grapes are a dense fruit. 
      <br> Here is a bar graph of the densities of the skittles. </p>
